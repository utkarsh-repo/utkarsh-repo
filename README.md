## 👋 About Me
I’m a **Cyber Security Engineer and Penetration Tester** focused on **manual Web, API, and Android application security testing**, with hands-on involvement in **DevSecOps security integration**.

I currently work as a **solo security engineer** in a SaaS startup, handling end-to-end security responsibilities including VAPT, secure SDLC guidance, CI/CD security checks, and vulnerability remediation.

I focus on understanding application logic, authentication flows, CI/CD pipelines, and real-world attack paths rather than relying only on automated scanners.

## 🧠 How I Approach Security Testing
- Begin with understanding the application’s functionality, user roles, and business workflows
- Identify trust boundaries across Web, API, Mobile, and CI/CD components
- Map authentication, authorization, and session handling before active testing
- Perform manual testing first to validate logic and access control issues
- Use tools to support findings, not to replace analysis
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on real-world exploitability and impact
- Reproduce issues reliably and provide clear proof of concept
- Share actionable remediation guidance aligned with secure development practices
